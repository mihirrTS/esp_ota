# PersonalCMS ESP32 DevKit V1 - Production E-ink Display Driver

## 🚀 Production-Ready Features

This is a **production-ready** version of the PersonalCMS ESP32 DevKit V1 driver with comprehensive improvements over demo versions.

### ✨ Key Production Enhancements

- **Physical GPIO Button**: GPIO 4 for reliable mode switching (no shared pins)
- **Device Removal**: Long press (5+ seconds) to remove device from server
- **Comprehensive Serial Monitoring**: Real-time system diagnostics and logging  
- **Production-Optimized Code**: No demo dependencies, memory efficient
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and reporting
- **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Timing and resource monitoring
- **Server Integration**: Complete device lifecycle management

## 🔧 Hardware Configuration

### Pin Assignment (Production)
```
Display Pins:
- RST  (Reset):     GPIO 25
- DC   (Data/Cmd):  GPIO 26  
- CS   (Chip Sel):  GPIO 5
- BUSY (Status):    GPIO 27
- PWR  (Power):     GPIO 33
- MOSI (SPI Data):  GPIO 23
- SCK  (SPI Clock): GPIO 18

Control Pins:
- MODE SWITCH:      GPIO 4  (Physical button - PRODUCTION)
- STATUS LED:       GPIO 2  (Built-in LED)
```

### 🎛️ Physical Button Wiring
Connect a momentary push button between:
- **GPIO 4** (Mode switch)
- **GND** 

The internal pullup resistor is enabled, so when button is pressed, GPIO 4 goes LOW.

## 📊 Serial Monitor Features

### Real-time Monitoring
The production version provides comprehensive serial output:

### 4. Production Operation
- **First Boot**: Creates WiFi captive portal for configuration
- **Normal Operation**: Connects to WiFi, syncs with PersonalCMS server
- **Mode Switch**: Press GPIO 4 button briefly to toggle Dashboard ↔ Images
- **Device Removal**: Hold GPIO 4 button for 5+ seconds to remove from server
- **Monitoring**: Watch serial output for real-time system status

## 📋 Production Features

### Device Removal Feature
The production version includes a **secure device removal feature**:

- **Activation**: Hold GPIO 4 button for 5+ seconds
- **Safety**: Multiple confirmation stages prevent accidental removal
- **Server Cleanup**: Removes device and all associated content from PersonalCMS server
- **Local Cleanup**: Clears all local configuration and restarts device
- **Visual Feedback**: LED patterns indicate removal progress and status

#### Device Removal Process:
1. **Hold Button**: Press and hold GPIO 4 for 5 seconds
2. **Warning Period**: LED blinks rapidly, can release to cancel
3. **Confirmation**: Continue holding for 3 more seconds to confirm
4. **Removal**: Device contacts server to remove itself completely
5. **Cleanup**: Local configuration cleared and device restarts
6. **Result**: Device enters setup mode for potential re-registration
